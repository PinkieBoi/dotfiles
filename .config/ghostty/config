# 
# To set a different left and right padding, specify two numerical values

# edge with zero padding other than what may be specified with the other
# `window-padding` options.
# 
# If other `window-padding` fields are set and this is `true`, this will still

# 
# The "extend" value will be disabled in certain scenarios. On primary
# screen applications (e.g. not something like Neovim), the color will not

# 
# * The nearest row has any cells that have the default background color.
#   The thinking is that in this case, the default background color looks
#   fine as a padding color.
# * The nearest row is a prompt row (requires shell integration). The

# preference but it may not always be possible.
# 
# Valid values:
# 
#   * `none` - All window decorations will be disabled. Titlebar,
#     borders, etc. will not be shown. On macOS, this will also disable
#     tabs (enforced by the system).
# 
#   * `auto` - Automatically decide to use either client-side or server-side
#     decorations based on the detected preferences of the current OS and
#     desktop environment. This option usually makes Ghostty look the most
#     "native" for your desktop.
# 
#   * `client` - Prefer client-side decorations.
# 
#   * `server` - Prefer server-side decorations. This is only relevant
#     on Linux with GTK, either on X11, or Wayland on a compositor that
#     supports the `org_kde_kwin_server_decoration` protocol (e.g. KDE Plasma,

#   * `dark` - Use the dark theme regardless of system theme.
#   * `ghostty` - Use the background and foreground colors specified in the

# can enable that. If this isn't specified, the app runtime will determine

# This controls whether an initial window is created when Ghostty
# is run. Note that if `quit-after-last-window-closed` is `true` and
# `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay` is set, setting `initial-window` to
# `false` will mean that Ghostty will quit after the configured delay if no
# window is ever created. Only implemented on Linux and macOS.

# The position of the "quick" terminal window. To learn more about the
# quick terminal, see the documentation for the `toggle_quick_terminal`
# binding action.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * `top` - Terminal appears at the top of the screen.
#   * `bottom` - Terminal appears at the bottom of the screen.
#   * `left` - Terminal appears at the left of the screen.
#   * `right` - Terminal appears at the right of the screen.
#   * `center` - Terminal appears at the center of the screen.
# 
# Changing this configuration requires restarting Ghostty completely.
# 
# Note: There is no default keybind for toggling the quick terminal.
# To enable this feature, bind the `toggle_quick_terminal` action to a key.

# The screen where the quick terminal should show up.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `main` - The screen that the operating system recommends as the main
#    screen. On macOS, this is the screen that is currently receiving
#    keyboard input. This screen is defined by the operating system and
#    not chosen by Ghostty.
# 
#  * `mouse` - The screen that the mouse is currently hovered over.
# 
#  * `macos-menu-bar` - The screen that contains the macOS menu bar as
#    set in the display settings on macOS. This is a bit confusing because
#    every screen on macOS has a menu bar, but this is the screen that
#    contains the primary menu bar.
# 
# The default value is `main` because this is the recommended screen
# by the operating system.

# Set it to 0 to disable animation completely. This can be changed at

# Set it to false for the quick terminal to remain open even when it loses focus.

# This configuration option determines the behavior of the quick terminal
# when switching between macOS spaces. macOS spaces are virtual desktops
# that can be manually created or are automatically created when an
# application is in full-screen mode.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `move` - When switching to another space, the quick terminal will
#    also moved to the current space.
# 
#  * `remain` - The quick terminal will stay only in the space where it
#    was originally opened and will not follow when switching to another
#    space.
# 
# The default value is `move`.

# Whether to enable shell integration auto-injection or not. Shell integration
# greatly enhances the terminal experience by enabling a number of features:
# 
#   * Working directory reporting so new tabs, splits inherit the
#     previous terminal's working directory.
# 
#   * Prompt marking that enables the "jump_to_prompt" keybinding.
# 
#   * If you're sitting at a prompt, closing a terminal will not ask
#     for confirmation.
# 
#   * Resizing the window with a complex prompt usually paints much
#     better.
# 
# Allowable values are:
# 
#   * `none` - Do not do any automatic injection. You can still manually
#     configure your shell to enable the integration.
# 
#   * `detect` - Detect the shell based on the filename.
# 
#   * `bash`, `elvish`, `fish`, `zsh` - Use this specific shell injection scheme.
# 
# The default value is `detect`.
