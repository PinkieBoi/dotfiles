# generally expected behavior.
# 
# On Linux, if this is `true`, Ghostty can delay quitting fully until a
# configurable amount of time has passed after the last window is closed.
# See the documentation of `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay`.
quit-after-last-window-closed = true

# Controls how long Ghostty will stay running after the last open surface has
# been closed. This only has an effect if `quit-after-last-window-closed` is
# also set to `true`.
# 
# The minimum value for this configuration is `1s`. Any values lower than
# this will be clamped to `1s`.
# 
# The duration is specified as a series of numbers followed by time units.
# Whitespace is allowed between numbers and units. Each number and unit will
# be added together to form the total duration.
# 
# The allowed time units are as follows:
# 
#   * `y` - 365 SI days, or 8760 hours, or 31536000 seconds. No adjustments
#     are made for leap years or leap seconds.
#   * `d` - one SI day, or 86400 seconds.
#   * `h` - one hour, or 3600 seconds.
#   * `m` - one minute, or 60 seconds.
#   * `s` - one second.
#   * `ms` - one millisecond, or 0.001 second.
#   * `us` or `µs` - one microsecond, or 0.000001 second.
#   * `ns` - one nanosecond, or 0.000000001 second.
# 
# Examples:
#   * `1h30m`
#   * `45s`
# 
# Units can be repeated and will be added together. This means that
# `1h1h` is equivalent to `2h`. This is confusing and should be avoided.
# A future update may disallow this.
# 
# The maximum value is `584y 49w 23h 34m 33s 709ms 551µs 615ns`. Any
# value larger than this will be clamped to the maximum value.
# 
# By default `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay` is unset and

# `false` will mean that Ghostty will quit after the configured delay if no
# window is ever created. Only implemented on Linux and macOS.

# The position of the "quick" terminal window. To learn more about the

#   * `bottom` - Terminal appears at the bottom of the screen.
#   * `left` - Terminal appears at the left of the screen.
#   * `right` - Terminal appears at the right of the screen.
#   * `center` - Terminal appears at the center of the screen.
# 
# Changing this configuration requires restarting Ghostty completely.
# 
# Note: There is no default keybind for toggling the quick terminal.
# To enable this feature, bind the `toggle_quick_terminal` action to a key.

# The screen where the quick terminal should show up.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `main` - The screen that the operating system recommends as the main
#    screen. On macOS, this is the screen that is currently receiving
#    keyboard input. This screen is defined by the operating system and
#    not chosen by Ghostty.
# 
#  * `mouse` - The screen that the mouse is currently hovered over.
# 
#  * `macos-menu-bar` - The screen that contains the macOS menu bar as
#    set in the display settings on macOS. This is a bit confusing because
#    every screen on macOS has a menu bar, but this is the screen that
#    contains the primary menu bar.
# 
# The default value is `main` because this is the recommended screen
# by the operating system.

# when switching between macOS spaces. macOS spaces are virtual desktops
# that can be manually created or are automatically created when an
# application is in full-screen mode.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#  * `move` - When switching to another space, the quick terminal will
#    also moved to the current space.
# 
#  * `remain` - The quick terminal will stay only in the space where it
#    was originally opened and will not follow when switching to another
#    space.
# 
# The default value is `move`.

# Whether to enable shell integration auto-injection or not. Shell integration
# greatly enhances the terminal experience by enabling a number of features:
# 
#   * Working directory reporting so new tabs, splits inherit the
#     previous terminal's working directory.
# 
#   * Prompt marking that enables the "jump_to_prompt" keybinding.
# 
#   * If you're sitting at a prompt, closing a terminal will not ask
#     for confirmation.
# 
#   * Resizing the window with a complex prompt usually paints much
#     better.
# 
# Allowable values are:
# 
#   * `none` - Do not do any automatic injection. You can still manually
#     configure your shell to enable the integration.
# 
#   * `detect` - Detect the shell based on the filename.
# 
#   * `bash`, `elvish`, `fish`, `zsh` - Use this specific shell injection scheme.
# 
# The default value is `detect`.
